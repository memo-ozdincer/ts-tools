"""Analysis tools for understanding GAD failure modes.

This module will contain:
1. Singularity analysis - correlate failures with λ₁ ≈ λ₂
2. Escape analysis - understand when v₂ kicks succeed/fail
3. Convergence analysis - study convergence patterns
4. TS clustering - deduplicate and categorize found transition states
